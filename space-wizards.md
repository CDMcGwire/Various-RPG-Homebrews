## Intro For Players

In another galaxy in another universe, mankind has spread throughout the stars
by means of magic, miracles, and technologies that blend the two with the
natural world. As they spread they quickly discovered other forms of life, some
hostile, some welcoming. It wasn't long before they were simply another of the
handful of lifeforms whose business was conducted across multiple planets.

Long ages have past since the first treks into the unknown and many great
civilizations have risen and been lost. In the current time, the traversable
Universe is a patchwork of factions of every kind of culture, some too beyond
human reasoning for them to live within.

In one corner of the Galaxy resides the Dominion of the Eternal: a civilization
lead, quite aptly, by a man believed to have attained immortality. (While many
outside the Dominion doubt it is true immortality, after the first 500 years it
became accepted that it was something close enough).

_**You**_ are part of an Inquisitorial Force from the Dominion and your current
mission is to seek out a witch that has been creating havoc in a more remote
star cluster of the territory. She is believed to be on the dead world Revinder.
Dominion Intelligence has not yet figured out how she has managed it, but they
believe she is the reason for the sudden appearance of foul kind of 'demon' in
the cluster, one which can traverse space unaided and has preyed upon travelling
ships and raided settled planets.

The Dominion military can handle the handful of demons that have thus far
appeared, but you and your team are to travel to Revinder and neutralize the
Witch as is deemed appropriate...

## GM Notes

### Part 1 — Landing on the Planet

The "bandits" are more of a species of territorial semi-nomadic aliens that
subsist on minerals which the Dead Planet is full of. However, the planet is
also unstable, so they are not happy to let "hunters" approach it, especially
since they have also entered into a protection agreement with the witch.

The aliens do not have a full colony on the moon yet, but they intend to without
the Dominion's permission. They have difficulty grasping human concepts of
territorial claims and do not respect such boundaries.

These aliens refuse to negotiate unless the encroaching party accept their
delegate onboard their ship. This would normally be seen as a danger for the
delegate, but this species can become explosively unstable on death, and so it's
more appropriate to say they request the other side to hold a talking bomb
during negotiations.

### Part 2 — Finding the Witch

Revinder itself is an unstable mess when the players arrive and the Witch is in
a ruin tucked into a ravine and guarded by three 'golems': artificial persons
animated by bound souls. The witch herself is an old crone that will not give
the players much time of day and will react violently if interrupted.

However, she has a 'daughter' of sorts residing with her in the ruin who is more
reasonable and can be convinced to help the players either pacify the witch or
reduce the risk of her blowing up the planet in her rage. The girl is magically
sealed in her room and will otherwise be fated to becoming the vessel of the
witch's soul.

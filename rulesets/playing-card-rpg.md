# Playing Card RPG

A minimalist rule set for playing RPGs in arbitrary settings using only a single
deck of standard playing cards as additional material. Intended to be run by
experienced Game Master's and lends itself to heavily improvised sessions.

> _This is something of an amalgamation of a bunch of experiments I had over the
> years. It will probably change even more in the future, but I think this
> should be a good home for it._

## Core Rules

The deck is shuffled and all players draw 3. When a player takes an action and
the GM deems their success is not guaranteed, the GM will tell the player to
play a card from their hand. The value of the card played determines the
outcome:

- [2-3] = Terrible Outcome
- [4-7] = Poor Outcome
- [8-J] = Good Outcome
- [Q-K] = Wonderful Outcome
- [Ace] = Guranteed Wonderful Success/Terrible Failure (Player's choice)\*
- [Joker] = Wonderful Outcome but the player's next card used counts as a '2'

> \*Aces can be used any time _**any**_ Player _**or**_ NPC performs an action.
> For example, if an enemy is about to fire a gun, a player can burn their Ace
> to force the NPC's action to fail terribly. The GM may then resolve that by
> having the gun backfire and injure said enemy. Alternatively, if one player
> fails a jump over a cliff, another kind teammate can burn their Ace to give
> them a miraculous recovery.

The GM should then come up with an appropriate description of how events unfold.

The player should discard to a separate pile. All cards in the main deck should
be used before the discard pile is shuffled and restored.

One other thing to note is that this system only applies to determining the
success of player actions. NPCs aren't bound by this and the GM may use whatever
method they deem appropriate to determine the result of an NPC's actions.

## Picking a Setting

There's no rules here. Either the GM can prepare something ahead of time or
everyone can pick as a group. It can be something made up on the spot,
historical, or an existing fictional world. Whatever the GM thinks they can
weave a fun adventure in.

## Creating Player Characters

Your group can filter down this list based on how much time you have/how much
effort you want to put in, but the suggested set of character details to fill
out are as follows:

- **Name/Title** — _Proper Introductions first_
- **Defining Personality Trait** — _What most people respect about you_
- **Defining Personality Flaw** — _What most people dislike about you_
- **Primary Skillset** — _A role you excel at_
- **Shortcoming** — _A role you can't perform_
- **Driving Motivation** — _The thing you strive for_
- **Conflicting Desire** — _A toxic need or habit that holds you back_
- **Signature Move** — _That special trick of yours_

> _**GM Note:** It is suggested that you have the players go through each detail
> one at a time, as a group. For instance, everyone takes turns comming up with
> and announcing their main personality trait, then everyone takes turns with
> their flaws, and so on. Players should be encouraged to comment on other's
> ideas and give suggestions, as long as they're being respectful._
>
> _As the GM, it'll be your job to help players flesh out their ideas, and make
> sure that they make sense within the context of the setting and the mood of
> the group as a whole._
>
> _As to what does and doesn't work for each detail, that depends mostly on the
> setting. Generally, subtle settings will work better with nuanced but
> realistic characters while extravagent settings do well with big personalities
> with exagerated traits. That is, "Master Sniper" works as a "Primarily
> Skillset" if your characters are soldiers in a big future war, but "Expert
> Stapler" might be more appropriate if you're middle schoolers trying to make
> it through a hectic day of school._

### Signature Moves

The final aspect of character creation is coming up with a signature move:
**this should not be skippd**. These are 'Ace in the Sleeve' type actions that
your character can perform so reliably, no check is needed, unless some extreme
circumstance makes it difficult or impossible (up to the GM's discretion).

Players create their abilites themselves, with the only rule being that the GM
must be okay with it (granted, a rather big asterisk for the more mischevous
types out there). The _Signature Move_ can be as useful or silly as the player
can imagine, but a good GM should reject ideas that are _uncreatively powerful_.

Good abilities are those that add to the fun and create interesting
opportunities in the narrative, but don't always solve problems on their own.
Bad abilities do more than one thing, are vaguely defined, and have no
possibility of adverse consequences.

### Good Examples

- _“Everytime my character winks at someone, that person throws up.”_
  - This ability works because, while it's almost magical in how it works, there
    is a simple way to explain it, it can be used to solve problems, and it can
    also cause problems in the wrong situations.
- _“I can paint a flawless portrait of anyone.”_
  - This is a good ability because it's very specific and would be nearly
    superhuman in real life, but its usefullness in an adventure depends on the
    context and creativity of the player.
- _“I always shoot first.”_
  - This type of ability works because, while it's somewhat vague and powerfull,
    it creates a very distinct behaviour pattern for the character and the GM
    can easily play around that _**“always”**_ if desired. It also doesn't
    gurantee the shot will succeed, just that it will happen before anything
    else.

### Bad Examples

- _“I can travel through time at will.”_
  - Unless playing a setting that specifically expects time travellers and super
    powers, this character will end up solving every problem by brushing it away
    under 'Time travel solved it.'
- _“I can paint a flawless portrait of anyone, even if I've never seen them.”_
  - This doesn't work because it has unexplainable methods purely for the sake
    of working around its natural limitations. Simply removing the 'never seen
    them' part would make this a fine ability as explained above.
- _“I can kill everyone I see before they can react.”_
  - This is a poor ability in 99% of scenarios because it is simply too powerful
    and has no interesting interactions unless every other character and NPC is
    equally powerful.

> _**GM Notes:** If a player gives an ability that is too vague or powerful,
> don't just shut it down, try to suggest conditions and details that would make
> it work. The player will either enjoy the suggestions and add them, or they'll
> make come up with something else as they decide that the idea isn't as great
> as they thought._

## Now what?

Well, that's really up to the GM. If you don't have any ideas, you're sore out
of luck. You could try a random plot generator, or do what I do and grab a stack
of Cards Against Humanity cards and start drawing until some horrible idea comes
to mind.

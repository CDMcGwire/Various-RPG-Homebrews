# Budget Witchers

A one-shot adventure originally for D&D 5e that has the players solving a town's
beast problem as a group of "Witchers."

## Setpieces

- A fight with an
  [Ironscale Hydra (D&D Beyond Link)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ironscale-hydra)
  in a creepy, foggy bog
  - _Post Mortem Notes: The assets files in this repo named "bog.png" and
    "bog-height-map.png" are what I used for the fight. "bog.png" is of course
    what the players see, while the "height-map" is an underlay to tell the DM
    how deep the bog is in different areas. Light: ankle-deep, no significant
    movement penalty; medium: wading, difficult terrain; dark: deep water,
    swimming rules._

## Outline

- Players arrive at the estate of a local Lord to accept a job to hunt an
  unknown monster preying on the populace.
- The monster attacks when the area is enveloped in fog. No bodies are left
  behind, but massive property damage and marks in the ground make it clear
  there was some kind of attack.
- The Players are made a fair offer, but get the chance to push a bit.
- If players are observant, they may notice one of the Lord's men is
  particularly cold towards the players
  - This man was one of the previous Lord's men (the previous Lord being the
    father of the current)
  - 35 years ago, a Witcher and a Sorceress had come to do a job, but while they
    were staying there, the Sorceress had done some… experiments.
- Players should then investigate the attacks
  - They can talk to some peasants to get testimonies
  - They can go to the known attack sites and try to get details
- If the players figure out it’s a Hydra, they can then attempt to mix a blade
  wax/oil that inhibits the Hydra's regrowth.
  - They may also make other Nature or History checks to determine the Hydra's
    strengths and weaknesses
- If the players are out near the bog when the fog rolls in, they will be
  ambushed by the Hydra.
  - When not foggy, the Hydra retreats deep into the bog.
- Once the players enter the bog, they are accosted by a group of black-clad
  humans.
  - Lead by the Captain Gennovar.
  - If no one is a sorceress he will simply ask them to skip the job and leave
    town.
  - If one of the players is a Sorceress, he will want that player dead.
  - If the player's refuse they attack.
  - Once back in town, if Gennovar is killed, the Lord will have to at least
    feign the arrest of the players to appease the populace of the town.
    - He's smart enough to know that Gennovar likely forced the player's hand,
      but if the populace catches the rumors they will begin to mob.
- Once the players have investigated the situation to the best of their
  abilities, they may each choose two potions to brew for preparation. We'll
  handwave the time it takes to gather reagents.
  - Since I don't want to go rules hunting for potions, I'll just have each
    player say two general effects they want for the fight, then we'll roll
    medicine or something to see how potent it is.

**!! Having any sort of bargaining/shopping is ill-advised considering the
length of the adventure.**

## Characters

- **Lord Berwik**
  - A jovial man who takes his job seriously, but tends to offend his more old
    school subjects with his willingness to breach tradition.
  - Happy to have the Witchers to hunt the beast and very accommodating.
- **Captain Gennovar**
  - The long standing Captain of the Guard, he's been in the guard for over 45
    years.
  - Has a deep grudge against sorceresses after one tricked a sick child in the
    community into (what was seen as) a horrific experiment around 30 years ago.
    The sorceress was accompanied by a Witcher at the time, so he and many
    others hold them in equal contempt.
  - A steadfast but stoic man to the community, but curt and secretive to the
    players.
- **Jasik the Farmhand**
  - A survivor of an attack. Mostly delirious. The player's will need to get him
    coherent before he can give any real information.
  - Players can learn the following:
    - It was foggy
    - The farmhands saw glints of gold in the fog
- **Kryspin the Hunter**
  - Middle aged man.
  - Cousin of the child that died 28 years prior.
  - Unless the players can get on his good side, he'll tell a lie about the
    monster.
  - He's a bit of a "chaser of pleasures" but not completely irresponsible.
  - The players find him at the bar drinking with his friends.
  - Players can appeal to his sense of duty to the people.
- **Old Lady Izolda**
  - A 74 year old woman who is a bit more amenable to the players.
  - Knowledgeable of many of the local stories and legends.
  - Has three stories that somewhat match the information from the attacks and
    witnesses.
    - One is a tale of Manticore that was fended off but never killed about a
      hundred years ago. The story states that the brave Warrior Anton lost
      track of the wounded beast when a thick fog rolled in.
    - One is a local legend of a nest of snake demons that tempt those who get
      lost in the fog with promises of gold and treasure, only to eat them when
      they chase after.
    - The last is the more recent tale of a Diseased Minotaur that had
      terrorized the roads 28 years ago. She tells the players that this is a
      very real story and is what brought the last Witcher and his Sorceress
      companion to the town originally, but its not one that most of the
      populace wishes to retell.

## Other DM Notes

I remember that at least one of my players mentioned that they would have left
willingly when confronted by Captain Gennovar. Likely your players will also opt
to follow along with the hunt, but if I ran it again I'd make the main objective
a bit more narratively compelling for the characters to be at odds with the
Captain.
